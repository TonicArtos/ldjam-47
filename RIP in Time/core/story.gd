	Last time we went to sleep, I had the worst nightmare. A tiny black hole blasted through the ship and sucked us in one by one. Even though we’re meant to be near-dead in the cryo-pods, I felt the terror in my bones. It made me dread this sleep. I hope we don’t have to do many more jumps after this, because I don’t think I can take it.""",

	Robbie’s getting smarter. The other day, I told her that the eliminator in cubicle 6 was busted. When she went to inspect it, I put a cucumber behind her so she’d see it and freak out when she turned around. I thought she was just checking out the plumbing, so I waited a bit, but then she asked me to get her a plunger. I turned around and tripped right over her damn arm! I don’t know how she got it there without me noticing, but boy did it hurt when I hit the floor. We should turn the gravity down in this place.""",

	I’ve been thinking about it, and there’s probably a more efficient way to mine ripcoins if the RIP drive is close to a binary black hole system, especially if the black holes have a rapid orbit around one another. Gravitational forces might be a problem. Will look into this later.""",
